<h1>Updates</h1>

**Updated February 6, 2019.** - We are moving from the GitHub support model to our Federal Service Desk for any issues. If you experience difficulty or have questions, your best course is to contact the Federal Service Desk (www.fsd.gov) and open a service ticket. This will get you funneled to the correct technical team who can troubleshoot and help you resolve any issues you may have. 

**Updated March 30, 2018.** - We completed our transition to email-verified API keys. If your existing API key no longer works, please submit a new request at [http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/key](http://gsa.github.io/sam_api/sam/key).

**Updated on October 23, 2017.** - Based on usage analysis, we recently modified the rate limits for the SAM APIs. The standard rate limits for the SAM APIs are now 1,000 calls per API key in a 24 hour-period, 5,000 calls per IP Address in a 24-hour period, and 5 calls per 5 seconds. If you need to have higher, customized rate limits, please submita request to our supporting Federal Service Desk at [www.fsd.gov](http://www.fsd.gov). Title it "SAM API Rate Limit Increase" and provide the email address you used to create the API Key, your Account ID, your IP Address, and a description of how you use the SAM APIs requiring a higher limit.

**Updated on October 30, 2015.** - The SAM team is happy to introduce v4 of the standard API and some updates to the v2 of the Search API. The updated field references for v4 can be found [here](fields4.html). We are also announcing that support for v1 and v2 will cease as of this release. We will continue to support only the latest 2 current versions of the API (v3 and V4). That being said, v1 and v2 will still be available for use, but we cannot provide resources for ongoing support as we would like to enhance the system for everyoneâ€™s availablilty and not dwell on outdated versions. If there are any questions or issues, please visit the [Support and Feedback](issues.html) to open a ticket.

**Updated on June 26, 2015.** - The SAM API has a release of v3 of the standard API and release of v2 of the [search](search.html) API. The updated field references can be found [here](fields3.html). Another new page which contains a better overview of the changes can be found in our [Versioning](versioning.html) document.The latest version of our Data Dictionary is available for download which will give a deeper look into the SAM system and how it functions.

The latest version of our [Data Dictionary](https://www.sam.gov/sam/transcript/SAM_Functional_Data_Dictionary.pdf) is available for download which will give a deeper look into the SAM system and how it functions.

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>The SAM API is a  RESTful method of retrieving public information about the businesses or  individuals (referred to as &ldquo;entities&rdquo;) within the SAM data set. The entities  publicly available data set can currently be retrieved on an entity-by-entity  basis. The initial SAM API release was introduced in June 2014 and allowed  users of the API to retrieve publicly available entity data. The next iteration  of the API, released in fall 2014, provided the ability to search SAM to find  an entity based on the search criteria submitted.<br />
  In  addition to the entity information, we also provide status and progress  information. This information is also included as part of the front end feature  for the SAM Status Tracker. The status refers to the status of the entity&rsquo;s  registration - whether they are working on their registration, waiting for a  validation from the IRS or the DoD (CAGE), or are active, as an example. The  progress is most relevant for those who are working on their registration; it  indicates whether a user has finished filling out different sections of their  registrations, as well as the progress of their validations with external organizations  such as the IRS or DoD. This should indicate how far along in the process a  user is in completing the work they need to do in order to successful be  registered in SAM.<br />
  Access  to the SAM API is administered through the API.Data.Gov which is an API  management service federal agencies.&nbsp; Consumers  of the SAM data must first register and obtain a key from the site.&nbsp; The key will allow users to access the SAM  APIs.</p>
<h1>SAM getData API</h1>
<p>The SAM getData API has one operation. The  operation will retrieve an entity&rsquo;s public information. Its endpoint is <a href="https://api.data.gov/sam/v1/registrations/">https://api.data.gov/sam/v1/registrations/</a><br />
  Please note: the rate limits for the API are  currently 5,000 calls per 24 hours and 5 calls per 5 seconds. As we go forward  and understand the impact of usage of the API on SAM, we will adjust the limits  accordingly as well as allow for individual users with specific needs to have  customized rate limits appropriate to their use.</p>

<h1>SAM searchData API</h1>
<p>The SAM Search API has been developed to  mimic the Search functionality that is currently available from the SAM  website. The Search API provides the opportunity to perform a search  transaction in the following two options. Quick Search takes a single search term  provided by the user and compares it to a set of predefined database fields.  Advanced Search allows the user to search by entering a value that is then used  to search a user selected predefined search category. <br />
  Notice that the searchData is through a JSON-based  &ldquo;hypermedia as the engine of application state&rdquo; (HATEOAS with the appropriate  links object within the result set). The intent going forward will be to use  this model to allow for a scalable architecture of IAE&rsquo;s APIs to be built. </p>
<h2>Version 1 (v1)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Added Advanced  Search features which allows users to search by specific fields</li>

##### Get started
We organized this site into four major areas.

- [API basics](basics.html) introduces you to the operations offered by the API.
- [API calls](console/) gives you a hands-on experience of those operations with an interactive console.
- [Field reference for v4](fields4.html) lists and describes the type of information provided by the API.
- [Feedback](https://github.com/GSA/GSA-APIs/issues) provides a forum for developers to share feedback and report problems.
